# core-linedrawing-benchmark
A simple experiment to measure the line-drawing performance of System.Drawing, ImageSharp and a custom implementation in .NET Core

# How to Run
Just open the solution and execute the project (ideally in Release). The results will appear on the output window. As an artefact of this operation a bunch of images are generated on the bin folder.
